FOR 3/9/23:
FIGURE OUT WHY SHIT DOESNT WORK WHEN BLANK (contacts, search, profile) (everything else works)
Profile isn't blank and doesn't work due to if else statements regarding user type. Without these profile does work
Search/Contacts still doesn't work when populated. No idea why. Maybe due to user type idk
Decorators may be the answer to user type issue.
MAYBE SPLIT INTO 2 PATHS WHERE EACH PATH POINTS TO THE OTHER AS THE REDIRECT BASED ON USER TYPE????
	DOES NOT WORK
MAIN ISSUE IS THE USER TYPE VARIABLE IS NOT POPULATING INTO A VARIABLE WHEN CALLED
	SOLUTION IS LINE 123!!!!!. WHEN CALLING A SQL QUERY FOR ONE VARIABLE, HAVE TO SPECIFY ITEM [0] SO IT ONLY SJOWS "FIRST" VARIABLE PULLED FROM A SEARCH/QUERY

3/15/23:
- Fixed Profile
	MAIN ISSUE IS THE USER TYPE VARIABLE IS NOT POPULATING INTO A VARIABLE WHEN CALLED
	SOLUTION IS LINE 123!!!!!. WHEN CALLING A SQL QUERY FOR ONE VARIABLE, HAVE TO SPECIFY ITEM [0] SO IT ONLY SJOWS "FIRST" VARIABLE PULLED FROM A SEARCH/QUERY
- Fixed Contacts and Search
	Remember that variable.x only needs to be called in loop

4/5/23
- Fixed Profile page to direct to update pages for both user types
	Buttons wouldn't work so used hyperlink instead, as no data manipulation in DB is required with said action

FOR 4/6/23:
FIGURE OUT WHY UPDATE PAGE'S BUTTON ISN'T LEADING TO PROFILE PAGES OR UPDATING DATA
	Cant pass in positional and named parameters
FIGURE OUT WHY CONTACTS PAGE'S BUTTON ISN'T UPDATING PAGE
	Notes in app.py
FIGURE OUT WHY SEARCH ISN'T POPULATING, DESPITE THE FACT THAT DB.EXECUTE QUERIES ARE WORKING

4/26/23:
- Fixed CONTACTS Page update function

FOR 6/15/23:
FIGURE OUT WHY UPDATE PAGE'S BUTTON ISN'T LEADING TO PROFILE PAGES OR UPDATING DATA
	Cant pass in positional and named parameters

FIGURE OUT WHY SEARCH ISN'T POPULATING, DESPITE THE FACT THAT DB.EXECUTE QUERIES ARE WORKING

OPTIONAL:
- Figure out how to hide additional fields for driver in register.html
- Maybe add phone numbers as well to all this? Or maybe only have that info and email show up on index page for others to view, not on search

Query for making contact lists:

CREATE TABLE contactlist (user_id INTEGER NOT NULL, user_type TEXT NOT NULL, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT NOT NULL, address TEXT NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id))
